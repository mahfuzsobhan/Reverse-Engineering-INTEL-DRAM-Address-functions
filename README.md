# Reverse-Engineering-INTEL-DRAM-Address-functions

This repository contains several tools to reverse engineer the undocument DRAM addressing functions on Intel CPUs and a library that automates the tools which previously needed hugely manual approach to map the functions. This code is provided as-is and we are not responsible for any data loss or risk caused by this code.

We tested the programs on x86-64 Intel CPUs with freshly installed Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Linux kernel 4.15.0. We have borrowed some code from TRResspass.
